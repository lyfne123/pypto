# Kernel-mode integration foundations

The public JIT eager entry borrows NPU arguments and submits through the optional
native torch_npu adapter. Kernel execution requires one `pypto.torch.init(...)`
per process. Explicit `.compile()` produces program objects.

## Public JIT eager entry

On this integration branch, `op(x, scale, out)` runs in kernel mode. The process
first calls `pypto.torch.init(...)` once (see
[kernel execution setup](#kernel-execution-setup)). The caller then supplies
real NPU tensors and every Out/InOut argument; there is no decorator mode
argument or explicit kernel compilation step. On each call PyPTO validates
arguments and snapshots typed scalar values and the current stream. Graph
capture requires each operator specialization to be warmed up beforehand. The
first valid call compiles a kernel artifact and prepares the callable on the
Worker created by `init`. Later matching calls reuse the artifact and
registration. Different operators share that Worker. Changing runtime scalar
values or streams does not recompile; changing a constexpr can select a
different artifact.

```python
import pypto.torch

# op is a @pl.jit entry; the caller selected the current NPU device.
pypto.torch.init()
x = torch.ones((16, 16), device="npu")
out = torch.empty_like(x)
op(x, 2.0, out)
```

This entry currently supports A2/A3 with `tensormap_and_ringbuffer`, including
non-default streams and taskQueue enabled or disabled. An optional
`config=CompileOptions(...)` supplies compilation options, which join the
specialization key. `RunConfig`, CPU/Meta/Fake tensors and Worker-owned handles
are rejected; they do not select another execution path. Native launch requires
rank 1–5 and positive uint32 extents/strides. A5 and HBG execution remain later work.
Direct JIT and registered torch.ops ACLGraph capture/replay are supported after
warmup, as described below. Automatic eager cleanup is
verified with torch_npu 2.6.0.post2 as described below; other framework versions
are rejected before native kernel initialization until their teardown contract
is validated. This remains integration-branch functionality.

Host/simulator and distributed execution use explicit program compilation:

```python
program = op.compile(host_x, 2.0, host_out, config=program_config)
program(host_x, 3.0, host_out, config=program_config)
```

Compilation alone never claims a process execution mode. Executing a program
and executing a kernel require separate processes. Program and kernel artifacts
have separate cache identities. Formal program calls, including restored objects
and orchestration children, require all Out/InOut tensors and return `None`;
they do not allocate omitted outputs. Low-level explicit Worker APIs retain
their existing memory-management behavior. Kernel calls return `None` or exactly
the original tensor objects selected by the IR return aliases, without allocating
outputs or running a warmup invocation.

## Kernel execution setup

Execution information is process state, not a call argument:

```python
import pypto
import pypto.torch
import torch_npu
from pypto.runtime import CompileOptions

torch_npu.npu.set_device(3)
pypto.torch.init(aicpu_thread_num=4)  # device=None uses the current torch_npu device
pypto.configure_cache(pypto.CacheConfig(enabled=True))  # optional process cache policy
op(x, 2.0, out)  # no execution information at the call site
op(x, 2.0, out, config=CompileOptions(analyze_auto_scopes_for_deps=True))  # compile options only
```

`init(*, device=None, platform="a2a3", runtime="tensormap_and_ringbuffer",
aicpu_thread_num=0)` runs once per process, before the first direct JIT or
registered torch.ops kernel call and outside graph capture. Before claiming
kernel mode it checks the target, the current torch_npu device, the framework
version and that no capture is active. It then claims kernel mode, installs the
framework shutdown integration and initializes the process Worker on its
lifecycle thread. It compiles and prepares no operator; every captured
specialization still needs warmup.

| Situation | Behavior |
| --------- | -------- |
| Kernel call before `init` | `RuntimeError` before argument binding, dependency discovery or compilation; the process stays unclaimed and may still call `init` |
| Repeated `init` with the same configuration | No-op |
| `init` with a different configuration | `ValueError`; no second Worker |
| `device` differs from the current torch_npu device | `ValueError`; `init` never switches devices |
| `init` inside graph capture | `RuntimeError` before any state change |
| Native initialization failure | Failure state is retained; use a new process |
| Registration, Fake/Meta calls, compiler tracing, program compilation | No `init` required |

Keeping execution information out of calls means graph capture, compiler
tracing and dispatcher registration never snapshot a device or runtime choice.
Direct calls and `register()` reject `RunConfig` and
`CompileOptions.distributed_config`: compile options use `CompileOptions`, and
persistent-cache policy uses `pypto.configure_cache`. A
`CompileOptions.platform` other than its default must equal the bound platform.
An active `PassContext` must name the bound runtime; without one, eager
compilation uses the runtime from `init`.

## Callable identity and hot-path measurements

Each loaded `KernelArtifact` memoizes the digest of the complete Simpler callable
and PyPTO ABI. Concurrent eager and capture lookups share this identity; a failed
descriptor build is not cached. Capture uses `loaded_identity()`, which never
loads or compiles an artifact. Process registrations still belong to their Worker
generation; only immutable binary identity is cached.

`tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_hot_path.py` defaults to 64 host-return samples per
entry/variant for direct JIT and registered `torch.ops`, with taskQueue off and
on. It writes p50/p99 in microseconds, validation/cache-key/descriptor counts,
and one-versus-two-producer throughput into JUnit properties. An uncached control
restores per-call descriptor hashing on the same build to isolate that cost.
Warmup and batch drains are outside the latency samples. Producer throughput uses
16-call batches with a serialized handoff and drain, included in elapsed time;
it does not measure unrestricted concurrent streams. Timings are evidence, not
CI pass thresholds. The small default checks counters and correctness; its tail
latencies are not a performance acceptance result. For the full measurement,
pass `--kernel-perf-samples=1024` to pytest. Keeping the same 16-call batch size
preserves the backlog counter contract while reducing repeated work in PR CI.

The pinned Simpler runtime rejects changing caller streams while the previous
caller's serial tail is incomplete (`PTO_RUNTIME_ERR_PREPARED_INCOMPATIBLE`,
`-1002`). Applications must establish completion before switching caller streams.
The adapter's host launch lock alone does not establish that device completion.
This also limits the two-producer experiment; removing a host lock cannot make
unrestricted multi-stream submission supported.

With taskQueue enabled, a deliberately blocked host callback holds exactly
0/16/256 initial tickets on another stream. Each measured batch adds 16 tickets,
then releases the gate and drains. A queued test-only stream fence completes
the background stream before the foreground launches reach Simpler; it executes
after gate release, outside host latency samples. The test asserts `16 * pending + 120` calls to
`done()` per batch, exposing the existing full-list scan. This blocked-queue
experiment cannot run with taskQueue disabled, where the gate executes inline;
ordinary latency and producer measurements cover both modes. Four tickets from
a destroyed graph currently cause four device synchronizations on the next eager
submission; a separate counter assertion records that behavior. Queue reclamation,
graph synchronization batching and lock removal remain separate changes with
lifetime, asynchronous-failure and Simpler concurrency requirements.

Build with `PYPTO_BUILD_TORCH_NPU_TESTS=ON` for these cases. That option adds private
`_test_counters()` and `_test_reset_counters()` hooks to the optional adapter;
normal builds omit the hooks and counter increments. Counts cover adapter
`Done()` calls and device-synchronization attempts, not all framework/SDK calls.
Both control and cached measurements use the same instrumented build. The kernel
eager device CI job runs these cases and uploads their JUnit evidence.

## Call metadata and ownership

[`CallSignature`](../../../../python/pypto/torch/interop.py) copies the shared
`ir.param_info.ParamInfo` signature once. `describe_call(args)` uses
`bind_complete_args`, so every Out/InOut parameter must be supplied before any
framework-context query. Return aliases are tensor indices in the complete
parameter list; an alias cannot refer to a scalar or an absent argument.

Each call produces a new immutable `CallFrame`:

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `tensors` | Tensor arguments in signature order, with original `param_index`, direction, dtype, shape, strides, format, logical pointer and storage bounds. |
| `scalars` | Current typed primitive values in signature order, with original `param_index`; mutable ctypes inputs are copied. |
| `device_index` | The current NPU device, checked against every tensor. |
| `stream` | This call's current torch_npu stream object, retained by the frame. |
| `capture_id` | Active native capture identity, or zero outside capture. |
| `return_tensors` | The exact caller objects selected by validated return aliases. |

Tensor and scalar ordering does not define a native ABI layout. Native argument
encoding consumes these values together with a validated kernel descriptor.
Addresses, scalar values and streams are per-call state, not compilation keys or
persistent metadata.

The frame retains each tensor and its storage object. `alias_result()` returns
`None`, one existing tensor, or a tuple of existing tensors. It never allocates
business outputs. Python ownership alone does not protect asynchronous device
use after the frame is released; native queue ownership and allocator stream
recording are supplied by the launch adapter described below. Callers must not resize or invalidate
borrowed storage while a frame is in use.

## Validation

- Accept real NPU torch tensors on one device. CPU, Meta/Fake tensors and
  Worker-owned objects are rejected; the adapter never selects program mode.
- Check dtype and rank against `ParamInfo`. Static carrier dimensions must
  match; `-1` dimensions use the current extent. Packed FP4 uses the carrier
  shape already provided by `ParamInfo`, without expanding it again.
- Require a contiguous strided view in base NCHW (0) or ND (2) format. Preserve
  nonzero storage offsets and logical data pointers. Other formats, transposed
  views, unresolved conjugate/negative views and invalid storage bounds fail
  explicitly, without copying or format conversion.
- Empty views access no elements, so their nonnegative storage offsets may
  exceed storage capacity. The accessed-range upper bound applies only to
  nonempty views.
- Accept exact tensor-view aliases and disjoint views of shared storage.
  Overlapping read-only views are allowed. Partially overlapping views involving
  Out/InOut require a richer alias contract and are rejected.
- Copy Python or correctly typed ctypes scalars using the program scalar type
  map. Integer values must fit their declared type; floats are not silently
  truncated into integers. This does not change JIT runtime-scalar or constant
  classification.
- Reject gradient-bearing tensors when autograd is enabled. `torch.no_grad()`
  inference may borrow model parameters; no backward implementation is supplied.

After argument validation, the adapter obtains the current device and stream on
**every call**. It requires the current device to match the tensor device and
checks the stream device. It does not switch devices, cache the first stream,
read `npu_stream`, synchronize, or enqueue commands. These context queries can
initialize torch_npu's own framework context; they do not create or initialize a
Simpler/PyPTO Worker.

## Internal schema and Fake/Meta helpers

`pypto.torch.registration.RegistrationSignature` copies the same `ParamInfo` carrier
shapes and return-slot indices. Its `schema(name)` method marks Out/InOut tensor
arguments writable and connects each tensor return to the corresponding input
alias set. All arguments remain required; no output allocation is inferred.
Scalar inputs map to dispatcher `SymInt`, `float` or `bool`. `SymInt` accepts
ordinary integers and preserves symbolic integers through dispatch, including
symbols without concrete hints. Scalar validation retains dtype range checks
without converting symbols to Python integers. Read-only input
identity returns, scalar outputs, scalar-only operators, invalid names and
aliases, and UINT64 scalars are rejected:
the dispatcher's signed integer type cannot represent the full UINT64 range.
Return aliases must name Out/InOut tensors: the dispatcher schema checker
rejects returning a read-only input object directly.

`fake(*args)` accepts FakeTensor or Meta tensors, validates dtype, rank, static
shape, contiguity, device consistency and inference-only use, then returns the
exact declared input objects. Dynamic dimensions and symbolic integer scalars
remain symbolic. Returning an input preserves its strides, storage offset and
alias identity, including empty slices. This helper never reads storage or data
pointers, queries NPU formats/device/stream, allocates business outputs or invokes
a Worker. Physical NPU format and overlapping-storage checks stay in the real
call adapter because abstract tensors do not establish those facts.

`define(library, name)` installs only the schema and fake kernel into a
caller-owned `torch.library.Library`. The caller must keep that library alive
and owns its registration lifetime. Repeated definitions, including a different
signature with the same name, raise PyTorch's duplicate-definition error;
existing definitions are not replaced. Importing or reloading this module does
not register an operator. The public `register` helper below owns its libraries
and supplies the actual device implementation. If the installed
PyTorch lacks `torch.library.register_fake`, the helper falls back to
`torch.library.impl_abstract` (available in PyTorch 2.2–2.3), preserving the
caller-owned library lifetime. If neither API is available, definition fails
before installing a schema. This optional helper requires one of these APIs;
the fallback does not add support for PyTorch 2.0–2.1 or change the package-wide
minimum dependency version.

The tests use temporary namespaces and CPU fixture implementations. On PyTorch
2.6, mutation-only schemas with no dispatcher return pass all
[`torch.library.opcheck`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.6/library.html#torch.library.opcheck)
checks and `torch.compile(backend="aot_eager", fullgraph=True, dynamic=True)`;
the test wrapper returns the caller's output tensor after the operator call.
Registered `torch.ops` tests verify that backed and unbacked integer symbols
reach the fake kernel unchanged without equality guards. A shape-derived scalar
test also verifies that different input sizes reuse one compiled graph.
API-selection tests emulate the older registration entry point on PyTorch 2.6
and verify Fake/Meta dispatch, duplicate rejection and library cleanup; they
do not establish end-to-end compiler compatibility on older PyTorch releases.
Opaque schemas with aliased returns are checked for schema correctness and
Fake/Meta behavior separately. The public registration below supplies a
decomposition so those returns also work through functionalization; opaque
aliased-return schemas alone are insufficient. Autograd is not provided.

## Registering a JIT kernel with torch.ops

```python
from pypto.torch import init, register

# op has fully shaped @pl.jit annotations, including Out/InOut directions.
registered = register(op, "my_kernels::op")  # needs no init
init()
registered(x, 2.0, out)
torch.ops.my_kernels.op(x, 3.0, out)
```

`register(kernel, name, *, constexpr=None, config=None)` derives the schema from
`kernel.specialize()` and the target-independent return-alias analysis. It does
not build binaries, allocate tensors, query an NPU context, require
`pypto.torch.init` or initialize a Worker. Real NPU invocations require `init`
and then follow the same implicit compilation, registration, current-stream
submission and shared Worker path as `kernel(...)`. Returning a
Tensor means returning the corresponding caller-owned Out/InOut object, including
repeated aliases. Every runtime argument is required, even if the Python function
has a default; output allocation is never inferred. CPU execution is not registered.

A tensor annotation must provide shape and dtype; declared dynamic dimensions
remain dynamic. `constexpr={"block": 16}` fixes compile-time parameters for one
operator name, using signature defaults when omitted. Runtime scalars stay in the
dispatcher schema. Use another name for another constexpr variant. Optional
`config=CompileOptions(...)` is part of the operator identity (omitting it equals
`CompileOptions()`) and is used by each underlying JIT call. `RunConfig` is rejected: the
device and runtime come from `pypto.torch.init`, never from registration.
Neither constexpr nor config is a runtime `torch.ops` argument.

PyPTO owns the registration libraries for the process lifetime. Repeating the
same name with the same JIT object, constexpr values and compile options returns
the existing overload; concurrent requests share one definition. Different JIT
objects or bindings, foreign definitions and internal-name collisions fail
without replacing anything. Reimporting a cached application module does not
register twice; reloading a module that creates a new JIT object requires a new
operator name. Reloading the registration helper itself preserves existing
libraries. `_pypto_` operator names are reserved for internal dispatcher entries.
Partial registration failure removes that attempt's definitions.

The public operator has the exact mutation/alias schema and a
`CompositeImplicitAutograd` implementation that calls an internal mutation-only
operator and returns the original arguments. The internal operator has a
PrivateUse1 implementation delegating to the JIT entry and a Fake/Meta validator.
This lets PyTorch functionalize the mutation without opaque aliased returns;
the wrapper creates no output tensors. Framework compiler transforms may manage
their own intermediate buffers. Both real and abstract execution validate the
registered shape/dtype contract; Fake/Meta never compile, prepare or launch.
Despite the dispatch-key name, this is inference-only: grad-enabled calls with
gradient-requiring tensors fail explicitly. `torch.no_grad()` and
`torch.inference_mode()` may use such tensors without a backward contract.

The tested compiler path is PyTorch 2.6 `torch.compile(backend="aot_eager",
fullgraph=True)`, including mutated outputs and repeated aliases in CPU fixture
tests. Real NPU tests cover direct and registered calls sharing artifacts and
handles, taskQueue on/off and compiled framework operations around a kernel.
Warmed `aot_eager` calls are also tested inside NPUGraph capture/replay, including
framework operations around the registered kernel. Warm up the compiled wrapper
itself outside capture, with the same guarded inputs and options; warming only
the underlying JIT operator does not compile a framework wrapper. This does not
establish support for every compiler backend or automatic graph capture.

## Optional dependencies and scope

`import pypto.torch` exports `register`. Importing it or its `interop`
or `registration` module does not request torch_npu, Simpler or a native launch
extension.
`torch` remains a normal PyPTO dependency. A real call description loads
`torch_npu` on demand and reports a targeted error if it is unavailable.

The direct and registered launch paths require the optional native adapter.
Direct JIT and registered torch.ops capture require prior warmup and use the
same graph lifetime integration.

## Process kernel Worker and registration

The internal `runtime.kernel.context.get_process_kernel_state()` owns the
process kernel Worker that `pypto.torch.init` creates through `ensure_worker`.
Kernel calls only read the bound configuration (`require_config`,
`bound_worker`) and never initialize a Worker; without `init` they raise the
not-initialized error. All operators share that manager; changing the operator,
scalar values or caller stream does not create another Worker.
`KernelConfig` fixes platform, runtime, device and AICPU thread count. Other
context resources currently use Simpler defaults. An incompatible configuration
is rejected instead of opening another Worker.

The integration SDK is pinned to
`4f162da09791eba7d1a380c9113e79d0bf0ecd0b`. Its supported Python surface is
`simpler.task_interface.ChipWorker.kernel_init`, `kernel_prepare_callable` and
`finalize`; the proposed L2 `Worker(execution_mode="kernel")` API is not present.
PyPTO's private adapter uses these existing methods. Init and prepare take no
caller stream; Simpler mints the native context generation and callable IDs.
The calling thread must already hold the framework's current device. The native
lifecycle thread borrows that ACL context without creating or resetting a device. Init uses
installed runtime binaries and checks capability; it does not compile an
operator or allocate business outputs. HBG kernel initialization is unsupported
at this pin even though HBG binary compilation works.

This pin adds two requirements PyPTO depends on. An onboard
`tensormap_and_ringbuffer` build must stage the separate kernel-mode AICore ELF
(`aicore_kernel_mode.o`): `RuntimeBuilder.get_binaries` then reports
`kernel_aicore_required` with a `kernel_aicore_path`, and `kernel_init` rejects
the configuration when that artifact is absent instead of falling back to the
program-mode binary. Registration also no longer synchronizes — success means the
callable image is uploaded and its residency recorded, not that the device
loaded the orchestration. That load belongs to the callable's first launch, so a
device-side refusal surfaces when the caller drains that launch rather than from
prepare. Simpler now also permits registration inside ACLGraph capture (init
still must complete outside it) and exposes a pre-init
`ChipWorker.probe_kernel_mode_supported(bins)`; PyPTO uses neither yet and keeps
requiring warmup outside capture.

The manager transitions through UNINITIALIZED, INITIALIZING, READY, FAILED,
CLOSING and CLOSED. Concurrent initialization shares one result. An init failure
retains its error and any partial Worker for cleanup, and never silently creates
a replacement. A PID check runs before taking inherited locks; a forked child
cannot use an initialized manager or its registrations. Forking before any
kernel initialization replaces only the unused Python state. Use a fresh spawned
process after native initialization.

`ensure_callable(artifact, config)` requires the Worker bound with a matching
configuration, then loads the artifact and hashes its full
serialized ChipCallable, tensor signature, target/runtime and PyPTO ABI
descriptor using Simpler's existing descriptor helper. It does not use an ELF
display hash, file path or Python object address as registration identity.
Concurrent requests for the same identity share one prepare result or error;
distinct identities register separately on the same Worker. A failed prepare
publishes no registration and can be retried. Prepare never warms up the operator
by executing it. Each `KernelRegistration` retains the callable, artifact and
manager, and validates its PID, manager generation and registry membership.
Native handles and registrations never enter the disk cache.

PyPTO program initialization paths (explicit chip/distributed Workers and
one-shot runners) claim program mode before native initialization; kernel init
claims kernel mode. The claim is process-wide and remains after failure or
close, so switching modes requires a separate process. Simpler supplies native
per-context mode checks and duplicate kernel-context rejection. Direct use of
third-party Simpler objects bypasses PyPTO's process gate; it is not a supported
way to combine program and kernel execution in one process.

## Automatic framework shutdown

PyPTO installs a versioned integration at torch_npu's existing shutdown boundary
before native Worker initialization. In torch_npu 2.6.0.post2,
[`_npu_shutdown`](https://github.com/Ascend/pytorch/blob/eef1d5ae62b9118ae78bf2d7084e6fba1b13058f/torch_npu/__init__.py)
calls `_C._npu_shutdown_synchronize()`, destroys process groups, and then calls
`_C._npu_shutdown(success)`. PyPTO wraps both native entry attributes: its one-shot
cleanup runs before the first synchronization, and the teardown wrapper also
covers an explicit teardown that bypasses that step. The original functions and
arguments are preserved. No additional `atexit(worker.close)` registration is
used, and importing PyPTO or compiling a program installs no hook.

The native framework
[teardown](https://github.com/Ascend/pytorch/blob/eef1d5ae62b9118ae78bf2d7084e6fba1b13058f/torch_npu/csrc/InitNpuBindings.cpp)
clears allocators and calls `NpuSysCtrl::Finalize`, which destroys events, streams
and devices. Kernel cleanup must finish before those operations. A native
`GetInitFlag()` check detects an already-finalized framework without initializing
it. Private shutdown entry points and this ordering are version-sensitive;
PyPTO currently admits only torch_npu 2.6.0.post2 for native kernel initialization.

Each native kernel Worker owns one persistent daemon lifecycle thread. Its
constructor/init, callable preparation and finalize execute on that thread with
the borrowed framework context, satisfying Simpler's init-owner-thread rule even
when `pypto.torch.init` ran on a short-lived background thread. Hot
launches stay on the existing native torch queue path. Successful close stops
and joins the lifecycle thread; a failed close keeps it alive for cleanup retry.
The thread is daemon because Python joins non-daemon threads before framework
exit hooks run; ordinary shutdown explicitly joins it before framework teardown.

The internal manager's `close()` can be requested from another thread. It first
stops admission, waits for initialization and in-flight preparation/admission,
drains accepted eager tickets, and finalizes on the native owner thread. Concurrent
close requests share the completed close, and repeated framework notifications
do not retry or double-finalize. Reentrant close from initialization/preparation
is rejected. Success clears registrations, invalidates handles and cannot
reinitialize. An unused manager creates no Worker and performs no native close.
Operator garbage collection does not close the process Worker.

Failed drain/finalize keeps ownership and registration records. If cleanup cannot
complete, or the framework is already torn down, automatic cleanup reports a
warning, stops admission, and anchors the manager with a deliberately unreleased
native Python reference. This prevents later interpreter/module clearing from
running Worker/event destructors against a destroyed ACL context. Framework
shutdown still proceeds; this is a failure fallback, not proof of safe resource
release. A proven successful cleanup that reports an earlier submission error
is reported separately. Forked children never close an inherited Worker. Abrupt
termination (`os._exit`, signals, interpreter crashes) provides no cleanup promise.

For participating `torch_npu.npu.NPUGraph` objects, cleanup first stops replay
admission, drains framework queues/device work and resets the live graphs. It
then releases graph tickets and finalizes the Worker. There is no public
close/shutdown ritual; see the capture contract below.

## JIT and torch.ops graph capture after warmup

Call `pypto.torch.init` before warmup; calling it inside capture, or capturing a
kernel call without it, is rejected. Warm up **every operator and
specialization** outside capture. Shape, dtype or
constexpr changes can select another specialization and require another warmup;
changing a runtime Scalar does not. Warmup executes the operator, so restore
InOut/output state if the captured computation expects its initial contents.
Compilation or a disk-cache hit alone does not register a callable with this
process's Worker.

After successful Device preparation, the process Worker retains an owning
registration indexed by operator, specialization and scalar ABI types. Capture
uses this index independently of the JIT compilation caches, so setting
`PYPTO_PROG_BUILD_DIR`, supplying `CompileOptions(output_dir=...)`, or clearing
compiler-cache entries after warmup does not lose the prepared callable.
Capture performs no compilation, binary loading or preparation. Failed preparation
publishes no entry, and closing the Worker invalidates all of its registrations.
Diagnostic eager/program calls still request fresh compilation outside capture.
`PYPTO_PROG_BUILD_DIR` alone is no longer a diagnostic request. Repeated eager
calls reuse compilation and registration with persistence disabled by default.
Enable persistence with `PYPTO_CACHE=1` or `CacheConfig(enabled=True)` for reuse
across processes. Environment policy uses the build directory's `.pypto-cache`
subdirectory unless overridden. Later processes still prepare their own Worker
and currently pay the installation inventory cost even on a READY hit.

```python
# op_a and op_b are @pl.jit entries; x, y, out are caller-owned NPU tensors.
pypto.torch.init()
op_a(x, y)
op_b(y, out)
torch.npu.synchronize()
# Restore any InOut state changed by warmup here.
graph = torch.npu.NPUGraph()
with torch.npu.graph(graph):
    op_a(x, y)
    op_b(y, out)
graph.replay()
```

Registered operators use the same contract. A matching direct JIT warmup is
sufficient for torch.ops capture and vice versa: the kernel object, constexpr
bindings and compilation/Worker configuration must match. Mixing both entries
in one graph shares the same Worker and existing callable registrations.
`register()` itself only defines dispatcher metadata and is not warmup.

```python
from pypto.torch import register

registered_a = register(op_a, "my_graph::a")
registered_b = register(op_b, "my_graph::b")
pypto.torch.init()
registered_a(x, y)
registered_b(y, out)
torch.npu.synchronize()
# Restore any InOut state changed by warmup here.
graph = torch.npu.NPUGraph()
with torch.npu.graph(graph):
    torch.ops.my_graph.a(x, y)
    torch.ops.my_graph.b(y, out)
graph.replay()
```

Dispatcher scalars are Python `int`/`float`/`bool` values; direct JIT additionally
accepts typed ctypes values. Both become the same typed ABI snapshot. A complete
two-operator example with numerical checks is available in
[`examples/runtime/torch_kernel_capture.py`](../../../../examples/runtime/torch_kernel_capture.py):
use `--entry torch_ops` (default) or `--entry jit`.

Capture only looks up an existing artifact and completed registration; it
neither initializes a Worker nor loads/registers new binaries. Execution
information is bound by `init` before capture, so a graph never records it. Missing warmup
raises `Kernel capture requires warmup outside capture for this specialization`.
The pinned Simpler registration path synchronizes its private AICPU stream, which
cannot be synchronized once another captured operator has joined it. Cold
multi-operator capture is tracked in
[Simpler #2255](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/issues/2255); the runtime
stream-separation fix is deferred. There is no automatic eager fallback.

Replay executes captured device work without entering Python JIT, compilation
or registration. Tensor addresses and typed Scalar values are snapshots of the
capture call. Updating storage contents at those addresses affects replay;
reassigning a Python Tensor or changing a ctypes Scalar does not retarget the
graph. Callers establish data dependencies when using different streams.

Captured tickets retain native Tensor/Storage owners until the ACL graph's
native destruction callback fires **and** device quiescence is established.
They do not use an eager completion event as evidence that future replay has
ended. The callback only marks host state; it performs no Python calls or ACL
cleanup. Reset and ordinary process shutdown drain work before releasing graph
resources. Operator/graph garbage collection never closes the process Worker.

On torch_npu 2.6.0.post2, the first accepted capture installs wrappers around
`NPUGraph.capture_end`, `replay` and `reset`. Only graphs containing PyPTO calls
are tracked, with weak references. Shutdown stops their replay entry before
synchronization, resets live participating graphs, releases retained tickets,
then closes the Worker before framework teardown. An unfinished/failed capture
or failed drain retains owners and reports the existing shutdown warning.
Low-level ACL graph APIs, saved unwrapped framework methods and other framework
versions are outside this lifecycle contract.

## Internal torch queue submission

`pypto.torch.launch.enqueue(registration, args)` takes a registration from the
process manager and complete arguments in logical signature order. It validates
the registration and describes a fresh frame, then returns the declared output
aliases after host admission. Return does not mean device completion. It never
compiles, prepares a callable, creates a Worker or allocates business outputs.

The optional `pypto._torch_npu` module constructs `ChipStorageTaskArgs` using the
pinned SDK headers. Tensor and scalar pools are independent: a mixed signature
`(x, scale, out)` produces two tensor entries and one scalar slot. The assembled
kernel ChipCallable includes `IN, OUT, SCALAR`, including in restored binary
manifests. Generated program tensor-direction metadata remains unchanged.
Scalars copy zero-extended object bytes, preserving float bits and signed integer
width. Tensor addresses point at the logical view, including storage offsets.
The current native launch requires rank 1..5, positive u32 extents/strides and
base-format tensors; empty views remain valid metadata but cannot launch yet.

`OpCommand::RunOpApiV2` places the native callback in the framework's current
stream queue. The callback invokes the public C++ `ChipWorker::kernel_launch`;
it executes no Python, JIT or prepare. The same callback runs inline when the
framework disables taskQueue. The adapter captures native Tensor and Storage
owners, a copied argument POD, callable ID and current stream. It does not cache
the first call's stream or read a queue-draining Python `npu_stream` property.
Capture-state inspection uses the borrowed stream without draining the queue.

The process manager retains every native ticket **before** enqueue, serializes
host admission and refuses stale registrations. Native storage owners cover
the delayed host callback. Allocator `recordStream` is applied once per unique
storage before submission, including aliased inputs/outputs. A completion event
recorded after Simpler's caller-stream join covers device use. Later calls reap
completed tickets without draining the host queue; internal `state.drain()` or
`close()` waits for outstanding work. A retained last ticket is
released at that drain/close boundary.

Submission and asynchronous callback errors propagate through the framework and
ticket wait. An error observed while reaping a previous ticket or draining work
marks the Worker `FAILED`, just as a synchronous enqueue failure does. Later
calls through any operator are rejected with `Kernel Worker is failed, expected
ready`, chained to the first observed submission error. A call that first
discovers the error during reaping reports an earlier asynchronous launch error
and does not prepare or enqueue a new ticket. Failure discovered during close
leaves the Worker `CLOSING` so cleanup can finish.
Failed or partially enqueued tickets retain their Worker, argument
and storage owners: a failed stream wait does not establish that Simpler's
internal streams are quiescent. Internal close drains the host callback and, only on failure,
requires a full device synchronization to establish internal-stream quiescence.
It then finalizes and releases owners, while re-raising the original submission
error. Failed quiescence or teardown retains all owners for a later close attempt.
There is no implicit reinitialization. The framework shutdown integration above
uses this drain/cleanup boundary.

### Building the optional adapter

The ordinary build defaults `PYPTO_BUILD_TORCH_NPU=OFF` and does not discover or
link torch_npu. Importing `pypto.torch.launch` remains safe without the extension;
a real enqueue reports how to enable it when absent.

```bash
# Use the same Python environment/compiler ABI for PyPTO and Simpler.
source .claude/skills/testing/load-env.sh
# Source the installed CANN set_env.sh to set ASCEND_HOME_PATH.
cmake -S . -B build -DPYPTO_BUILD_TORCH_NPU=ON
cmake --build build --parallel "$PYPTO_BUILD_JOBS"
```

The adapter is compiled against the installed torch/torch_npu headers and
libraries and CANN from `ASCEND_HOME_PATH`. The supported build requires the
C++11 libstdc++ ABI and compatible nanobind builds. The adapter embeds and checks
the exact Simpler revision. Simpler's Python module hides its C++ symbols, so
the adapter compiles the pinned SDK Worker implementation directly and uses
nanobind's registered `ChipWorker` type. It neither redefines the runtime ABI
nor extracts private context pointers; it creates no additional Worker. Rebuild
both modules together after changing the SDK, framework or compiler ABI.

The hardware test's deterministic host-queue gate is a separate, non-installed
module, enabled only with `-DPYPTO_BUILD_TORCH_NPU_TESTS=ON`. Add
`build/torch_npu_tests` to `PYTHONPATH` when running that test. No fault-injection
or queue-blocking entry is shipped in the production adapter.

## Verification

### Integration-branch CI

Pull requests targeting `feat/kernel-mode-integration-test` run the
`Kernel Mode CI` workflow. Its required stages are pre-commit (without
clang-tidy), focused kernel CPU regressions with the native adapter disabled, pinned
toolchain resolution, and a native adapter build plus targeted device tests.
The CPU suite includes JIT routing, ABI/compiler/artifact contracts, Worker and
shutdown state, torch interop/registration/launch/capture, JUnit evidence checks,
and the optional-import guard from PR #2785 (09A). The explicit selections live
in `.github/scripts/kernel-mode-cases.sh`; this PR workflow does not run the
repository-wide unit or device matrices. Those tests remain available to run
manually. CPU tests and pre-commit start independently; device jobs depend only
on toolchain resolution. The final result still requires every job to pass.

Each device job requires one NPU and uses the shared `[self-hosted, linux, npu]` pool,
the existing `setup-ci-job` bundle environment, and `task-submit` with the
runner's `DEVICE_ID`. It installs Torch 2.6.0 and torch_npu 2.6.0.post2 in its
isolated environment, requires C++11 ABI, and builds both the adapter and the
test-only queue gate from the checked-out source. The installer selects packages
for the runner architecture. ARM64 uses the Torch CPU index and the
SHA256-pinned torch_npu CPython 3.10 wheel. x86_64 uses the Torch
`cpu-cxx11-abi` index and the CPython 3.10 wheel from Ascend's C++11 ABI zip.
Both torch_npu packages come from the official `v7.1.0.2-pytorch2.6.0` release;
that version is not on PyPI. Release downloads allow up to ten minutes per
transfer, with a 15-second connection timeout and a one-minute low-speed cutoff
below 1 KiB/s, so slow downloads can finish without letting stalled transfers hang.
Up to four attempts resume interrupted transfers from the bytes already received;
if the server rejects resuming, the next attempt starts from zero. Only a completed
download is passed to the installer.
The job checks the Torch ABI before building.
Device preflight reuses the runtime framework-version check, accepting the
C++11 ABI build suffix while still requiring release 2.6.0.post2. The full
task log is uploaded even if preflight fails before producing JUnit evidence;
a missing or failed JUnit report still fails the job.
The job installs the pinned dependencies in `.github/requirements/kernel-mode.txt`:
CANN 9 TBE's base dependencies and PyYAML, an undeclared torch_npu wheel dependency.
It checks torch_npu and TBE imports before building the adapter; sourcing CANN's
environment alone does not install its Python dependencies into the job venv.
The native build uses `build/kernel-native`, separate from the shared setup's
scikit-build wheel cache in `build/`. It verifies that the source-tree core,
adapter, and test gate can import before allocating a device.
Simpler and pto-isa come from
the submodule pin; ptoas comes from `toolchain/versions.env`. CANN comes from the
runner's `CANN_ROOT` and must satisfy the adapter's documented prerequisites.
No device work runs outside a task allocation.

Two matrix jobs, `device-tests (eager)` and `device-tests (capture)`, run the
eager/stream/lifecycle/program regression cases and warmed capture/replay cases
independently. They can run in parallel when runners and devices are available.
Each job owns its checkout, environment, build, device allocation, report check,
and task cleanup. `fail-fast: false` lets the other job finish after one fails.
Their artifacts are `kernel-device-eager-results` and
`kernel-device-capture-results`; each contains only that suite's evidence.
The PR selection contains 10 eager cases and 6 capture cases:

- Eager: direct JIT in both queue modes, explicit program regression, registered
  `aot_eager`, submission failure in both queue modes, a delayed host callback,
  normal process shutdown, and the two small hot-path counter runs.
- Capture: cold-call rejection, queue-off direct JIT replay, registered storage
  ownership and shutdown, a mixed-entry multi-operator graph, and `aot_eager`
  capture. This samples key contracts without their full Cartesian matrix.

Every selected device case must pass without skips. Explicit pytest node IDs
make missing or renamed cases fail collection. Pytest runs serially on the
allocated card; its cases create isolated processes as needed.

Artifacts retain JUnit reports, the actual chip name/device id, source and SDK
revisions, Python/Torch/torch_npu/nanobind versions, `npu-smi` output, and CANN
version metadata when provided by the installation. Missing, empty, malformed,
failed or skipped device reports fail the report check. The final
`Kernel Mode required results` job runs even after upstream failures and
requires every stage, including both device matrix jobs, to succeed; skipped or
cancelled jobs cannot satisfy it.
Configure that check in the integration branch's merge rules if it should be
enforced by GitHub; defining a workflow alone does not change repository rules.

This is CI wiring for the current A2/A3-family TRB implementation, not full
platform acceptance. Each artifact records the actual chip tested; a pass on
one chip does not establish separate A2 and A3 results. A5, HBG and the complete
platform matrix remain pending in 09C. Capture still requires prior warmup.

The shared `run_without_optional_runtime` unit-test fixture runs a fresh Python
process with `torch_npu`, `simpler`, `simpler_setup`, `_task_interface` and
`pypto._torch_npu` blocked by an import finder. It detects both import statements and dynamic
`importlib.import_module()` calls, including attempts whose `ImportError` is
caught by the caller. Explicit enforcement checks remain active under
`PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1` and `2`; negative controls cover both settings and normal
execution. PyTorch backend autoload is disabled in that subprocess
to isolate PyPTO's behavior from installed framework plugins. The guard's own
negative tests ensure an attempted import cannot silently pass on a CPU runner
where the dependency is already absent.

These checks cover package import/reload, program configuration and registered
Fake/Meta dispatch. They run in the focused kernel unit-test CI job without
optional runtime dependencies or a new device job. They do not validate native
adapter builds or device execution; those require the integration branch.

`tests/ut/torch/test_interop.py` uses real CPU storage with an emulated NPU device
label and stubs only framework format/context queries. It tests view offsets,
aliases, independent scalar/stream snapshots, ownership, invalid inputs and
imports with optional runtime dependencies forbidden.

`tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_torch_interop.py` checks actual NPU tensors,
non-default streams, offset views and noncontiguous-input rejection. It skips
when a real NPU is unavailable or the selected platform is a simulator. These
are metadata tests, not PyPTO kernel-execution tests.

`tests/ut/runtime/test_kernel_context.py` covers shared initialization and
registration, configuration conflicts, shared prepare failures, stale/forked
handles, ownership, owner-thread shutdown and retry. The isolated cases in
`tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_kernel_context.py` exercise real A2/A3 TRB
init/prepare/close with two DSL callables, duplicate native kernel-context
rejection and HBG capability refusal. They require the pinned runtime binaries
and a reserved NPU. They do not launch a PyPTO kernel or validate capture.

`tests/ut/torch/test_launch.py` checks dispatch, scalar encoding, aliases and
missing/incompatible extension errors. Manager tests cover retention, reaping,
failed admission and close ordering. `tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_torch_launch.py`
uses a generated scalar-bearing DSL callable with taskQueue enabled/disabled,
non-default streams, framework A → PyPTO → B ordering, offset views, changing
scalars, GC/allocation pressure, owner-thread close, a deliberately blocked host
callback and native error injection. These require a reserved A2/A3 NPU and
both locally built adapters. They do not claim A5 or ACLGraph acceptance.

`tests/ut/torch/test_registration.py` covers schema mutation/alias contracts,
Fake/Meta and symbolic inputs, isolated imports, duplicate definitions, and
dispatcher/compiler integration with CPU fixtures, registration lifetime/conflicts,
rollback, inference guards and routing into the JIT entry.
`tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_torch_ops.py` checks real NPU eager and aot_eager
execution through the public registration with taskQueue on/off and shared
Worker/artifact/callable reuse. It exits normally without a user close call.

`tests/ut/torch/test_init.py` checks explicit initialization: current-device binding, idempotence and conflicts, and rejection before claiming kernel mode for unsupported targets, device mismatch, unverified framework versions and active capture.

`tests/ut/jit/test_kernel_eager.py` checks public entry routing, the not-initialized error before argument binding, `RunConfig` rejection, `CompileOptions` specialization, bound target/device/runtime checks, preflight rejection, scalar snapshots and cache separation. `tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_jit_eager.py` verifies the not-initialized error, Worker initialization inside `init`, real repeated InOut updates, constexpr variants, one shared Worker and isolated explicit program execution.

`tests/ut/runtime/test_kernel_shutdown.py` checks lifecycle affinity, initialization
races, idempotent close, framework ordering, failure retention, version refusal and
fork handling. `tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_kernel_shutdown.py` uses ordinary
Python subprocess exit (not multiprocessing's `os._exit`) with no user close or
drain. It covers taskQueue on/off, a departed first-caller thread, two operators,
delayed host callbacks, partial initialization, repeated notifications and a
failed finalize retained through framework teardown.

`tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_capture.py` runs the same direct JIT and torch.ops
matrix: warmup refusal, single/multiple operators, multiple graphs/streams,
persistent-cache reuse, scalar snapshots, storage ownership, graph reset/GC/recreation
and ordinary exit with pending replay, with taskQueue enabled and disabled.
Cross-entry cases warm through either entry and capture through the other or mix
entries in one graph. Additional cases reject a kernel call captured without
`init` and `init` called inside capture. Replay must not reenter Python JIT, compile or prepare.
`tests/st/runtime/kernel/test_torch_ops.py` also checks warmed `aot_eager` calls
inside capture, including the surrounding framework operations and output aliases.
`tests/ut/torch/test_capture.py` covers graph ownership and shutdown admission;
manager/JIT tests verify that capture never initializes, compiles or registers.
